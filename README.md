# website-design-system

Basic design system for a website built in HTML &amp; CSS

This is a collection of all the colours, fonts, and some of the repeating styles.

Developers and designers use design systems in order to organize the look and feel of a website or web application. Design systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website.

My style guide/design system includes a section on colours, fonts, and specific text styles, with the capability to extend this as I progress.
